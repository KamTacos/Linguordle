    <h1>Welcome to Linguordle!</h1>
    <p>
        Guess the language, and the game will tell you the closest shared classification between your guess and the answer. 
        The fewer guesses you use, the better!
    </p>
    <p>Languages include only living, non-isolate, non-artificial languages from Glottolog.</p>
